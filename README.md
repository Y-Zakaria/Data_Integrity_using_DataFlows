# Data_Integrity_using_DataFlows
A large part of real-time systems have mandatory security requirements in addition to timing con- straints. The aim of this project is to use the environment of simulation and development LIDE (Lightweight Dataflow Environment) to propose different security solutions for a Synchronous DataFlow application. First, we study the paradigm of Synchronous DataFlow in LIDE. Then my contribution is to propose two different LIDE implementations using C language to investigate the integrity issue of data exchanged during the execution, the first implementation concerns SHA1 algorithm and the second concerns Tiger algorithm. After that, I propose an integration of those solutions on a LIDE application to secure data exchange. The final phase of the project is about evaluation of the additional execution costs due to integrating of such security solutions in a Synchronous DataFlow application
